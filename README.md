<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Screenshot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/4skinSkywalker/pretty-damn-cool-editor/)

This rich text online editor is meant to protect your privacy, just encrypted contents get stored on the web, everything else never leaves the client (neither your password nor your clear text).
The idea is to integrate this editor with the IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) which is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system.
On the IPFS is possible to upload files but neither modify nor delete them, for this reason the editor keep tracks of changes by referencing IPFS IDs in a git-like fashion with branches and commits.

Key takeaways:
* Preserves your privacy;
* Use a distributed immutable file system (yet to be implemented);
* Versions your files.



### Built With

* [Quill](https://quilljs.com/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
